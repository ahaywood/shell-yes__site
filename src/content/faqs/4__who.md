Hi! 👋 My name is Amy Dutton. I’m a Lead Maintainer on the [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) core team 🌲. I have over 24 years of web experience, officially making me a granny 👵 in Internet years. I live right outside of Nashville, TN with my husband 👨, 3 adorable kids 👦👧👧, and 2 dogs 🐶🐶. If I’m not sitting in front of my computer making things, I’m hanging out with family and friends. I love streaming all the things 📺, playing cards ♠️, reading 📚, and drinking coffee ☕. [Lots of coffee.](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/selfteachme) ☕☕☕
